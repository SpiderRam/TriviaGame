# TriviaGame

This was the homework assignment for week five of the bootcamp.  The requirements were:

~You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

~The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

~The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

~Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

~Don't forget to include a countdown timer.

Opportunities for improvement:  

--better styling of the radio buttons, and hiding the empty space rather than just the content.

--make the results sharable (on Facebook, etc.)

--add easier and harder levels, unlock when user scores perfect

--show the wrong answers and provide the correct ones
